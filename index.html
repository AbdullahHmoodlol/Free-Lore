  <h1>The Entire FNAF Lore (So Far)</h1>
  <p><em>By Me: Certified Lore Excavator & Pizzaplex Detective</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNAF) series is a sprawling, twisted horror epic involving <span class="highlight">haunted animatronics</span>, <span class="highlight">child murder</span>, and a pizza place no one should ever eat at. Here's a digestible breakdown of the whole lore — with collapsible timelines, major events, and multiverse mayhem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Pre-1983: The Birth of Afton & The Company</summary>
      <p>
        William Afton and Henry Emily form a business: <strong>Fazbear Entertainment</strong>. Afton secretly starts experimenting with child-killing tech (yikes). They create Fredbear’s Family Diner. Animatronics are introduced. Possession begins. The <span class="highlight">Golden Freddy</span> incident is foreshadowed.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>1983: The Bite of '83</summary>
      <p>
        Afton’s son (often called the Crying Child) is bullied and forced into Fredbear’s mouth by his brother. He dies horribly. The brother regrets it forever. Fredbear's is shut down. Afton spirals deeper into madness. Animatronics get creepier. The <span class="highlight">first haunting</span> occurs.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>1985: The Missing Children Incident</summary>
      <p>
        Afton kills five children using a Spring Bonnie suit. The kids’ souls possess Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy. Fazbear Entertainment covers it up. The first proper <strong>Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza</strong> is opened and closed repeatedly due to supernatural nonsense.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>1993: FNAF 1</summary>
      <p>
        Mike Schmidt (possibly Michael Afton) becomes a night guard. Haunted animatronics attack. Phone Guy warns you. Freddy sneaks through the dark like a horror ninja. Mike gets fired for "tampering with animatronics." Ghosts still not at peace.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Post-FNAF 1: Michael’s Redemption Arc</summary>
      <p>
        Michael Afton tries to undo his father’s legacy. He takes jobs at every cursed Fazbear location. He literally gets <span class="highlight">scooped</span> in Sister Location. Becomes a walking corpse. Still keeps going. Hero energy.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>FNAF 3: Springtrap Rises</summary>
      <p>
        Afton is springlocked (crushed by his own suit) and becomes <span class="highlight">Springtrap</span>. A horror attraction opens (because capitalism). Michael burns it down. Ghosts are freed. But wait... Springtrap survives. Because of course he does.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>FNAF 6: Pizzeria Simulator</summary>
      <p>
        Michael lures all remaining haunted souls and Afton into one final trap. <strong>Henry Emily burns them all</strong> in a fiery finale. Souls supposedly find peace. Afton? Not so much.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Ultimate Custom Night (UCN)</summary>
      <p>
        Afton is tormented in a digital hell created by the spirits he wronged. You play as him. He never escapes. End of the road, right? Ha! You wish.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Security Breach (SB)</summary>
      <p>
        Set in the future. A massive mall called the <strong>Mega Pizzaplex</strong> is haunted by a digital virus — <span class="highlight">Glitchtrap</span> — who is Afton’s AI ghost, of course. Gregory and Glamrock Freddy team up to stop the return of the murder ghost dad. Multiple endings. The lore is now a multiverse spaghetti mess.
      </p>

    <h2>Key Characters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>William Afton:</strong> The main villain. Serial killer. Springtrap. Glitchtrap. All-around bad dad.</li>
      <li><strong>Michael Afton:</strong> Son of William. Hero. Undead. Kinda tragic.</li>
      <li><strong>Henry Emily:</strong> Co-founder, father of Charlie (The Puppet). Ends it all in FNAF 6.</li>
      <li><strong>The Puppet:</strong> Gives life to haunted animatronics. Protector spirit.</li>

    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “This series started with jump scares and ended with existential crisis robots. And that’s beautiful.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>FNAF lore is chaotic, fascinating, and still evolving. Whether you’re Team Bite of '83 or Team Bite of '87, the takeaway is this: never trust a children's pizza chain run by a guy named William.</p>
